# Code Repository for Worker Versioning (TypeScript)
This repository provides code used for exercises and demonstrations
included in the TypeScript version of the 
[Worker Versioning](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/worker-versioning) 
training course.

It's important to remember that the example code used in this course was designed to support learning a specific aspect of Temporal, not to serve as a ready-to-use template for implementing a production system.

For the exercises, make sure to run following command in one terminal to start the Temporal server: 

```sh
temporal server start-dev \
    --ui-port 8080 \
    --db-filename clusterdata.db` \
    --dynamic-config-value frontend.workerVersioningWorkflowAPIs=true \
    --dynamic-config-value system.enableDeploymentVersions=true
```

For more details on this command, please refer to the `Setting up a Local Development Environment` chapter in the course. Note: If you're using the Codespaces environment to run this exercise, you can skip this step.
